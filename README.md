Designed to analyze glioblastoma (GBM) cell and brain organoid data exported from Imaris. 

More specifically this package extracts, performs relavent comparative statistics, and generates figures for the following data: total number of GBM cells, distance of each cell to the nearest surface of the organoid (distance to surface), number of GBM cells whose distace to surface exceeds a defined invasion threshold, brain organoid volume and brain organoid surface area.
