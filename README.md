# gbm_org_analysis

Designed to analyze glioblastoma (GBM) cell and brain organoid data exported from Imaris. 

Specifically, extracts, generates figures and performs relavent comparative statistics on the following data: total number of GBM cells, distance of each cell to the nearest surface of the organoid (distance to surface), number of GBM cells whose distace to surface exceeds a defined invasion threshold, brain organoid volume, and brain organoid surface area.
